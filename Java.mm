It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that code written in Java can run on a variety of different computers and operating systems without modification. Java is used to develop a wide range of software, including mobile apps, desktop applications, and server-side systems. It is also commonly used for developing games and other interactive multimedia. Java is known for its &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; philosophy."/>

A package is a collection of classes and interfaces that are grouped together based on their functionality.
